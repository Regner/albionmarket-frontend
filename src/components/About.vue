    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Albion Market was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/gtaylor/EVE-Market-Data-Relay">EVE Market Data Relay</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theatrus/eve-central.com">eve-central.com</a>. With Albion Market relying on as many people as possible installing the client, and it is just the nice thing to do, all of the data Albion Market has is provided to others via an API. Be sure to check out the <router-link to="/api">API</router-link> page if you're into developing things and would like some market data.</p>
